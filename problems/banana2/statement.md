Jakob and Monica are head rangers at the zoo, which looks after many manic monkeys.

Every day, Jakob and Monica need to buy enough bananas to placate the monkeys, so they do not start a monkey uprising.

Bananas cost 3 special banana tokens, and both Jakob and Monica have to contribute at least one token. How many possible bananas could Jakob and Monica buy?

### Input

Input will contain two integers, $J$ and $M$, the number of banana tokens held by Jakob and Monica respectively.

### Output

Output a single integer, the total number of bananas that Jakob and Monica can buy.

### Constraints

* $1 \leq J, M \leq 10^{10}$

### Example Run

Input
```
2 7
```

Output
```
2
```

Explanation

Jakob and Monica can first buy a banana with 2 of Monica's tokens and 1 of Jakob's tokens, and repeat this process. This leaves Monica with 3 tokens, which she cannot use.
